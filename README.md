# AurorAI
AurorAI  Your AI-powered study companion with a calming aurora-inspired interface.  AurorAI helps students learn smarter with effective flashcards and note making, interactive quizzes, and personalized AI chat box. Built for focused, engaging, and adaptive study sessions.

AurorAI is a Python-based desktop AI chatbot built using **PyQt6** for the user interface and an **AI API** for intelligent responses.  
It focuses on delivering **clear, structured, and meaningful answers**, including technical explanations and study notes.

This project demonstrates **AI integration, desktop UI development, and prompt-driven response quality**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **UI Framework:** PyQt6  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API  
- **Core Modules:**  
  - `QtWidgets` (UI components)  
  - `QThread` (background processing)  
  - `pyqtSignal` (thread-safe UI updates)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a prompt in the PyQt6 chat interface  
2. The input is sent to the AI API in a background thread  
3. The AI processes the request and generates a response  
4. The response is displayed in the chat window without freezing the UI  

Special attention is given to **UX, response clarity, and application stability**.
